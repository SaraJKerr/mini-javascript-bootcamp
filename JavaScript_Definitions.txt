- Variables 
	A variable can be a number, a string or a boolean value. Variables act as a 
	container or placeholder for its content. They are called variables because they can
	change.
- Strings
	A string is a character, word or sentence. Strings are enclosed in speech marks.
- Functions (arguments, return)
	A function is a bundle of code with a specific purpose. The code is enclosed in curly
	braces. A function can have arguments, these are variables which are applied to the 
	code when it runs. The word return instructs the computer to give the result of the 
	code and to stop.
- if statements
	An if statement enables the computer to consider alternative results. The
	if statement includes an expression where the computer will consider whether the 
	variable input meets a particular criteria. If it is true it will return one result, 
	if false a different result.
- Boolean values (true, false)
	Boolean values are values which have only two possible outcomes e.g. true or false, 1
	or 0.
